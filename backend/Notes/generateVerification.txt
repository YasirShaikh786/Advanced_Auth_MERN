export const generateVerificationCode = () => {
    return Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000).toString(); 
};




1. export: 
   - Makes this function available for use in other files/modules. It's part of ES6 module syntax.

2. const generateVerificationCode: 
   - Declares a constant named generateVerificationCode, which is assigned an arrow function (=>).

3. Math.random():
   - Generates a pseudo-random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

4. Math.random() * 900000:
   - Scales the random number to a range between 0 and 900,000.

5. 100000 + Math.random() * 900000:
   - Shifts the range from [0, 900,000) to [100,000, 1,000,000), ensuring that the result is always a six-digit number.

6. Math.floor(...):
   - Rounds down the result to the nearest integer, effectively creating a six-digit whole number.

7. .toString():
   - Converts the numeric value into a string.

Example Outputs
Each call to generateVerificationCode() will produce a random six-digit string, such as:
- "123456"
- "789012"
- "345678"

Why Use This Approach?
- Uniform Distribution: This ensures that all six-digit numbers have an equal chance of being generated.
- Simplicity: The logic is concise and easy to understand.
- Suitability for OTPs: This approach is commonly used for generating one-time passwords (OTPs) or verification codes. 

If you use this in a production environment, consider additional measures like uniqueness or a time-limited validity for the generated codes.
